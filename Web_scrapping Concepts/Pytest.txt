What is Pytest:
    Pytest is a testing framework based on python. It is mainly used to write API test cases
    Pytest is a python based testing framework, which is used to write and execute test codes.
    In the present days of REST services, pytest is mainly used for API testing even though we can use pytest to write simple to complex tests, 
    i.e., we can write codes to test API, database, UI, etc.

Advantages Of Pytest:
    1.Pytest can run multiple tests in parallel, which reduces the execution time of the test suite.
    2.Pytest has its own way to detect the test file and test functions automatically, if not mentioned explicitly.
    3.Pytest allows us to skip a subset of the tests during execution.
    4.Pytest allows us to run a subset of the entire test suite.
    5.Pytest is free and open source.
    6.Because of its simple syntax, pytest is very easy to start with.

What is Assert:
    # In Selenium, Asserts are validations or checkpoints for an application
    # Asserts in Selenium validate the automated test cases that help testers understand,
    # if tests have passed or failed.


How To Execute of Subset of test suite:
    #In a real scenario, we will have multiple test files and each file will have a number of tests. 
        Suppose, we want to run only a specific set of tests; how do we go about it?
    #Pytest provides two ways to run the subset of the test suite.
        #Select tests to run based on substring matching of test names.
        #Select tests groups to run based on the markers applied.

        commamd:
                pytest -k <substring> -v

        -k <substring> represents the substring to search for in the test names.
