There are two main components to initiate the communication - Client and Server.
We use HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), which enables the communication between a client and server over the Internet.
Python provides the requests module, which allows us to make these requests using the Python script.

#Request_Library:
    1.Requests library is one of the integral part of Python for making HTTP requests to a specified URL.      
    2.Python requests module has several built-in methods to make Http requests to specified URL
      using GET, POST, PUT, PATCH or HEAD requests
    3.A Http request is meant to either retrieve data from a specified URI or to push data to a server
    4.It works as a request-response protocol between a client and a server.
   
    it is the most powerful tool of Python that allows us to send requests on the web. 
    It includes many features and methods to send HTTP requests. The system that sends requests is known as the client,
    and the system that holds the webserver is known as a server.

#Methods:
    GET - It is used to request data from a server.
    POST - It is used to submit some data to the server for processing it.
